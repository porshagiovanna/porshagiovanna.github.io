Teaching Portfolio:

Welcome to my Teaching Portfolio, here is what you need to know:

Structure:
- Home Page 
- About me Page 
- Teaching Philosophy 
- Perfessional Development 
- Resources 
- Resume & Contact 

In each section, you can expect:
- Home Page - begin reading introduction information and click links to other pages while listening to relaxing music (a personal favourite song)
- About Me Page - read personal information and flip each image to read more about Porsha. 
- Teaching Philosophy - read Porsha's Philosophy 
- Perfessional Development - click the link to the ACU degree, view previous TECH projects and the list of completed TAS units. 
- Resources - list of teacher and student TAS resources with links attached to the actual documents. 
- Resume & Contact - Porsha's resume and a contact form for viewers to fill out. 

(All pages have a "next page, previous page" button, connecting all pages together).
