								<p>Teaching is not merely a profession that transfers knowledge, it is transformative experience that empowers students to reach their full potential, igniting a passion for lifelong learning. To create a student-centred, inclusive and respectful classroom is personally paramount, offering unconditional support that reminds all learners of their purpose and showcases all unique strengths and needs. I am committed to ensuring all student’s feel valued and heard, establishing a deep sense of community that promotes empathy and justice. My teaching philosophy promotes critical thinking and creativity, striving to make learning relevant and meaningful by connecting it to students’ personal experiences and interests, thereby catering to diverse learning styles. Nonetheless, continuous improvement is a cornerstone to this philosophy, ensuring continual diligence and proactiveness in my practice. Education is a dynamic process, involving great commitment to foster a positive and effective learning environment that equitably enriches the lives of all learners.</p>
								<p>When reflecting on myself as a learner, I emphasize my strong sense of independence and determination throughout my educational journey. My diligent and committed approach has enabled me to achieve many self-set goals that once seemed out of reach. Particularly, my skills in Design & Technology have opened up new accomplishments and opportunities for further learning. I have also faced personal and social challenges during unpredictable times, which have influenced my perspective and growth.</p>
